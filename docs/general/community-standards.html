<h1 id="jellyfin-community-standards">Jellyfin Community Standards</h1>

<p>As time marches on and Jellyfin, and the Internet more broadly, continues to grow, it is important to establish standards by which community members should interact. While there are numerous such &quot;Codes of Conduct&quot; out there, I am not a fan of most, and I felt it important to establish our own, suited to our project, as well as a dispute resolution mechanism tailored to our needs. Questions about this document should be directed towards me. --Joshua, Project Leader</p>
<h2 id="mission-statement">Mission Statement</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Jellyfin aims to be the best media streaming platform possible, built entirely by volunteers without any monetary gain, proprietary/locked features, or unreasonable centralization.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Jellyfin is a project made up entirely and exclusively of Volunteers who donate their free time to the project.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fostering a community of respectful and productive contributors is central to our success and longevity.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Jellyfin is not and will never be under the control of any corporation or profit-driven entity, and does not exist to make money for anyone, including any volunteer contributors or the project leadership.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h2>
<p>At all times when interacting with the Jellyfin community via any method (Matrix, Reddit, Forums, etc.), you must abide by the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Respect others and remember the Human.</strong> Do exhibit kindness and empathy to others, and make them feel welcome. Do not antagonize, flame, insult, demean, abuse, or harass others. Do not use slurs or sexualized language. Do not dox or otherwise expose others&#39; private information, even if it is shared publicly elsewhere.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>English is the primary working language of Jellyfin, but the majority of our community do not speak English as their primary language</strong>. Be patient when language issues arise, and do not mistake incomplete language knowledge for ignorance or worse. Always act in good faith and give other contributors the benefit of the doubt, and try to read positivity rather than negativity into messages where at all possible. If you are having trouble communicating an idea in English, please post in your native language and ask for help, and someone is likely to understand. As per rule 1, abuse of community members due to language issues is not tolerated.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Jellyfin, as set out in our Mission Statement, is created exclusively by volunteers. As they are freely giving their time and effort, <strong>no volunteer contributor owes anything whatsoever to any other contributor, any user, or the project itself</strong>. Contributors are free to come and go as they please, to work on and give attention to what they deem interesting or important, and to respond or not respond to anything they wish. That said the administrative team would kindly request that regular contributors inform us of long-term departures to ensure we are aware, should the need arise.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you have questions to ask of the community, <strong>please choose the appropriate location</strong> (see our <a class="xref" href="getting-help.html">Getting Help</a> page) and <strong>ask your question in full, immediately, with as much detail as possible</strong>. Author issues aside, <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">Asking Questions the Smart Way</a> is a valuable resource. <strong>Do not pester or harass</strong> community members for help or to answer questions, <strong>do not require others to pry information</strong> out of you, and <strong>do not spam questions</strong> - they will be answered when they are answered.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Jellyfin is a media server system for your own media collection. Our communities are not a place to obtain media. <strong>Do not engage in, encourage, or facilitate piracy</strong>. Do not ask questions about where to obtain media. Do not ask for access to other users&#39; servers, or sell or transfer access to private servers in our communities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dispute-resolution-and-moderation">Dispute Resolution and Moderation</h2>
<p>Disputes are inevitable, including violations of the rules above. When these occur, the following policy applies.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Before any other resolution step, we trust the community to police itself. If you see a community member violating these community standards, please let them know, and link them to this document. Do not respond in kind (e.g. respond to a flame with a flame). Most disagreements can be solved with education and discussion.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the issue cannot be resolved between the contributors, any complaints, instances of explicit rulebreaking, or unresolvable disagreements with other community members may be directed towards the Administrative team, or the Project Leaders directly. You may do so through email (<code>team [at] jellyfin.org</code>) or on Matrix via a direct message. Please include details and context as appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The team will review the complaint and decide on an action, including but not limited to: informal private guidance, informal private warnings, formal public warnings, temporary ban(s) from the various platforms, or permanent ban(s).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Formal warnings will be made under a &quot;second-chance-only&quot; policy. Once warned, if one repeats the same behaviour, the response will escalate as appropriate to the infraction.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Moderation tasks in some locations are delegated to other team members. This dispute resolution procedure applies anywhere under the Jellyfin umbrella. The Administrative team and Project Leaders retain final say in any dispute resolutions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="changelog">Changelog</h2>
<p>This document represents official Jellyfin project policy. Any changes to this document require a changelog entry here and approval by a Project Leader.</p>
<p>2020-09-14, Joshua Boniface: Initial version of the community standards document. Based <em>very</em> loosely on several CoCs including the Contributor Covenant, and various Forum rules I&#39;ve read and written over the years.</p>
